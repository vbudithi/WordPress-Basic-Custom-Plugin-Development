#Basic Custom plugin developement

#Here, I have created a custom plugin name as 'real- unit'

1. Install the wordpress(5.2.2 and above) in your local server(Xamp or Wamp).
2. Paste the created plugin folder in the directory wp-content/plugins.
3. Now go to the admin panel(dashboard) -> Plugins -> Installed plugins and 
here we can see the custom plugin name(real-unit). Now activate the plugin by clicking on 
activate button.
